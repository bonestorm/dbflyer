1. when dragging selected things in the grid and you drag outside of the window it will clip to inside of the window and that's good
  but if you unclick while it's outside of the grid, the items won't be moved.  it should move to the clipped position
  this will need recognition of mouseup when dragging even outside of the grid.  this is already done for the tab menu so you can look
  at it as a template maybe
